# Surfs Up
## Overview 
This analysis was done to determine if a surf and ice cream shop is a good investment on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. 

We gathered a variety of weather information from around the island to determine this including, average temperatures, percipitation and wind speed. We looked at this information over the course of multiple years and from multiple weather stations across the island.

## Results
We looked in depth at weather trends in June and December to see if the surf and ice cream shop are sustainable year-round. 
- For June, we found that the mean temperature was 74.9, minimum temperature was 64 and maximum temperature is 85. 
- In December we found that the mean temperature is 71, minimum is 56 and maximum is 83. Which is really pretty similar to the June information. 
- Here are tables summarizing this information for easier viewing:

## Summary
- In summary, the June and December temperatures look pretty similar, which is good. December is a little cooler but that is to be expected, however, the average high in December is about 4 degrees lower than the average temperature in June. 
- To gather more information, we could also look at precipitation information for June and December. We could also look into wind speed information for June and December. Both of these elements can affect how successful a surf and ice cream shop will be in Oahu.
